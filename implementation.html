    <details>
        <summary>1.0 Get the Data</summary>
        <p>1.1  Initially, we had hoped to access the data "live"</p>
        <p>This was not possible - so the rest of the presentation/demo will be with a static file.</p>
        <p>We'll talk about the cloud access at the end.</p>
        <p>Our Focus became how incorporate user input, flexibility, and choice within visualizations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For this project, we used a static download of the dynamic data file for data at Bridge 1</li>
            <li>We created a python file to join the data together from Bridge 1:  "infovis.py"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will be creating time series charts, so date (which comes in as a string) needed to be converted to "date" format</p>
