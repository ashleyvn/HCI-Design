    <h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>

    <details>
        <summary>1.0 Get the Data</summary>
        <p>
            1.1  Initially, we had hoped to access the data "live" 
            This was not possible - so the rest of the presentation/demo will be with a static file.
            We'll talk about the cloud access at the end.

            Our Focus became how incorporate user input, flexibility, and choice within visualizations.
            For this project, we used a static download of the dynamic data file for data at Bridge 1**
            We created a python file to join the data together from Bridge 1:  "infovis.py"**`

            We will be creating time series charts, so date (which comes in as a string) needed to be converted to "date" format`
        </p>
    </details>

<script type="module">
import define from "./date.js";
import {Runtime, Library, Inspector} from "./runtime.js";

const runtime = new Runtime();
const main = runtime.module(define, Inspector.into(document.body));
</script>
