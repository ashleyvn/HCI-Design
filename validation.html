        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>The initial design idea was to have different graphs for each attribute.</li>
                <li>The visualization implemented shows all the attributes in a single graph.</li>
                <li>The tooltip is also updated to show the readings of the selected attributes, along with the date and time.</li>
                <li>A feature to display images at various time stamps is also incorporated.</li>
                <li>Users are also allowed to choose the dataset (normalized / raw) they wish to visualize.</li>
                <li>Users can also choose to download their dataset for further analysis on other platforms.</li>
            </ul>
